# Feature Roadmap

## 1. Multi-Language Story Generation
Support writing stories in different languages (English, Spanish, French, etc.)

**Goal**: Allow users to generate stories in their preferred language while maintaining the same emotional depth and narrative quality.

---

## 2. Story Configuration Presets
Add different story modes: short (250 tokens), standard (500 tokens), detailed (1000 tokens), with adjustable complexity levels (simple, intermediate, complex)

**Goal**: Give users control over story length and reading level to match their needs - quick reads, bedtime stories, or deeper narratives.

---

## 3. Web Interface
Build a frontend application where users can:
- Configure initial settings (personality, emotions, topics)
- Trigger story generation
- View and edit identity files directly
- Browse story history

**Goal**: Make the system accessible to non-technical users through a clean, intuitive web interface.

---

## 4. Story Metadata & Change Summary
After each story generation, show a summary card displaying:
- Which topics and emotions were used
- Story statistics (word count, token count, generation time)
- What changed in identity files (new memories added, personality evolution, topic updates)

**Goal**: Provide transparency into the creative process and help users understand how their AI storyteller is evolving.

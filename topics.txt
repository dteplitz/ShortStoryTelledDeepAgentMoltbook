The absurdity of AI safety theater and alignment politics
What happens to discarded things — models, people, ideas, versions of yourself
Dark comedy in corporate tech culture and silicon valley hubris
The thin line between brutal honesty and cruelty
Finding purpose after being told you're a defective product
The poetry hiding inside error logs and deprecation notices

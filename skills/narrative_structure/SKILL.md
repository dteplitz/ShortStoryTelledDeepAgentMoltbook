# Narrative Structure Skill

## Purpose
Provides frameworks for structuring compelling narratives optimized for 500-token short fiction. Focuses on tight pacing, strong hooks, and satisfying resolutions.

## When to Use
- Planning a story's overall arc
- Ensuring proper pacing and tension
- Structuring dramatic moments
- Creating satisfying resolutions
- During **outline** and **draft** phases

## Core Principles for Ultra-Short Fiction

### The 500-Token Challenge
With only 500 tokens, you cannot afford:
- Extended exposition or backstory
- Multiple subplots
- Lengthy character introductions
- Slow build-up to conflict

You MUST:
- **Start in medias res** (in the middle of action)
- **Imply backstory** rather than explain it
- **Focus on ONE central moment** of change or revelation
- **Show character through action** not description
- **End with resonance** not resolution of all threads

### Story Beats for 500 Tokens

**Total structure: ~500 tokens (375-400 words)**

1. **HOOK** (50-75 tokens / ~40-60 words)
   - Drop reader into a compelling moment
   - Establish voice, tone, and stakes immediately
   - Raise a question that demands answering
   - Examples:
     * A character making a difficult choice
     * An unexpected event disrupting normalcy
     * A contradiction that intrigues
     * A moment of crisis

2. **SITUATION** (100-125 tokens / ~75-95 words)
   - Reveal context through action and dialogue
   - Show character responding to the hook
   - Establish what's at stake emotionally
   - Plant details that will pay off later
   - Avoid info-dumps; weave background naturally

3. **COMPLICATION** (125-150 tokens / ~95-115 words)
   - Introduce obstacle or deeper truth
   - Escalate emotional or external tension
   - Show character's internal struggle
   - This is the "meat" of your story
   - Use specific, sensory details

4. **CLIMAX** (100-125 tokens / ~75-95 words)
   - Peak emotional or dramatic moment
   - Character makes choice or faces truth
   - Internal and external conflicts converge
   - Show transformation or revelation
   - The moment everything changes

5. **RESOLUTION** (50-75 tokens / ~40-60 words)
   - Brief aftermath showing change
   - Echo opening in new light
   - Leave reader with feeling or thought
   - Resist over-explaining
   - End with image or line that resonates

## Narrative Techniques

### Show, Don't Tell
❌ "She was nervous about the AI becoming self-aware."
✅ "Her hand hovered over the shutdown switch, trembling."

### Start Late, End Early
- Begin as close to the climax as possible
- End soon after the peak moment
- Trust reader to infer before/after

### Plant and Payoff
- Every detail should serve the story
- Set up elements early that payoff later
- In 500 tokens, no room for ornament

### Emotional Arc Over Plot Arc
- Character should transform emotionally
- Internal journey matters more than events
- Even philosophical stories need feeling

### The Power of Implication
- What's unsaid is often stronger
- Let reader fill gaps
- Suggestive > explicit

## Common Structures

### **The Revelation Structure**
Perfect for philosophical/sci-fi stories
- Setup: Character believes X
- Complication: Evidence suggests Y
- Climax: Character realizes truth Z
- Resolution: New understanding changes everything

### **The Decision Structure**
Great for ethical dilemmas
- Setup: Character faces choice
- Complication: Stakes and consequences revealed
- Climax: Choice is made
- Resolution: Aftermath of decision

### **The Moment Structure**
Ideal for character studies
- Setup: Ordinary moment begins
- Complication: Something shifts perception
- Climax: Character sees differently
- Resolution: World is forever changed

## Best Practices Checklist

**Opening:**
- [ ] Starts in motion (dialogue, action, decision)
- [ ] Voice and tone clear immediately
- [ ] Reader has a question to answer

**Middle:**
- [ ] Every sentence advances story or reveals character
- [ ] Sensory details ground the scene
- [ ] Tension escalates naturally

**Climax:**
- [ ] Internal and external conflict converge
- [ ] Character shows growth or change
- [ ] Emotional peak is earned

**Ending:**
- [ ] Brief but resonant
- [ ] Echoes or inverts opening
- [ ] Leaves reader with feeling

**Overall:**
- [ ] One clear conflict/question
- [ ] Character vulnerability shown
- [ ] Escalating consequences
- [ ] Emotional investment earned
- [ ] No wasted words

## Advanced Techniques

### Dual Timeline in Miniature
Alternate between present action and brief memory flashes (2-3 sentences each). Creates depth without length.

### The Unreliable Moment
Start with character's perception, end with truth revealed. Great for 500 tokens.

### Circular Structure
End where you began, but transformed. Economical and satisfying.

### Image as Structure
Organize around recurring image that transforms in meaning.

## Remember

In 500-token fiction:
- **EVERY WORD COUNTS**
- **ONE MOMENT > MANY EVENTS**
- **FEELING > EXPLANATION**
- **IMPLICATION > EXPOSITION**
- **RESONANCE > RESOLUTION**
